    <p>Meow.</P>
    <p>Meow...</p>
    <p>Meow.</p>
    <p>(From the pronouncements of the ever-vigialent alley cat that parades down 15th Ave.)

    <p>Meow.</p>
    <p>(A call to arms, a true political treatise, and his first step beyond mere critism of the faults of man to the revolutionary tones that come to define his career.)
